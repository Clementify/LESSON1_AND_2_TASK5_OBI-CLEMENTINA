                Sewing is the craft of fastening or attaching objects using
                stitches made with a sewing needle and thread. Sewing is one of
                the oldest of the textile arts, arising in the Paleolithic era.
                Before the invention of spinning yarn or weaving fabric,
                archaeologists believe Stone Age people across Europe and Asia
                sewed fur and leather clothing using bone, antler or ivory
                sewing-needles and "thread" made of various animal body parts
                including sinew, catgut, and veins. For thousands of
                years, all sewing was done by hand. The invention of the sewing
                machine in the 19th century and the rise of computerization in
                the 20th century led to mass production and export of sewn
                objects, but hand sewing is still practiced around the world.
                Fine hand sewing is a characteristic of high-quality tailoring,
                haute couture fashion, and custom dressmaking, and is pursued by
                both textile artists and hobbyists as a means of creative
                expression. The first known use of the word
                "sewing" was in the 14th century
